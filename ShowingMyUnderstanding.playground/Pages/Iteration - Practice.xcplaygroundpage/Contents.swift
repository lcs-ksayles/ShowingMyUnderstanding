 # Iteration - Practice
 
 How can loops be used to make a program more effient?
 
 How can loops be used to create an interesting image from repeated patterns?
 
 Here is an example image:
 
 ![tire-tracks](tire-tracks.png "Tire Tracks")
 
 Try creating this image for practice.
 
 You should only require 6 lines of code at most to produce the image.
